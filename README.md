Environments for our pangeo deployment

## Dont merge into master.

This env is for the `jupyter lab` that runs allowing the users in interact with the other envs (which are kernels).

The name of the env will be the name of the repo.

Add env vars to travis for all outputs from `scripts/setup_az_sp.sh`
